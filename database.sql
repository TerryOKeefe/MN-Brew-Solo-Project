Cool the wort. Sanitize the gear. Siphon the cool wort from the kettle into the jug. Aerate the wort. Add the yeast packet. Seal the fermentor. Move the fermenter to a dark, quiet spot until fermentation begins.', 'Fermentation begins. Within a day or so of Brew Day, fermentation begins—as yeast cells convert malt sugars into CO2 gas and alcohol, you will notice bubbles come through the airlock and a cap of frothy foam form on the beer. Fermentation ends. Roughly one to two weeks from Brew Day, fermentation will end—the exact timing depends a lot on temperature and also on wort biochemistry that we won’t worry about right now. Don’t be alarmed if it takes a few less or a few more days—brewing is an art as well as a science, and your beer will be fine. When the supply of malt sugars in the wort is depleted, the yeast cells begin to go dormant and sink to the bottom of the fermentor. Bubbles come through the airlock very infrequently or stop entirely, and the cap of foam starts to subside or disappears. If you have it attached, remove the blowoff tubing once things have settled down, and replace it with the airlock until you’re ready to bottle.', 'Move the fermentation jug to a table or countertop. Do this early, so the yeast and sediment has a chance to re-settle! Sanitize the gear. Connect one end of the hose to the Auto siphon, and the other end of the hose to the bottle filler. Start the siphon and fill the bottles. Remove the airlock and stopper from the jug and place the Auto-Siphon into the beer; while holding down the bottle filler to keep the valve open, have your helper pull up, then push down on the siphon piston to begin the flow of beer. Just lift up on the filler to stop the flow of beer. Try to leave about 1” of headspace in each bottle. Add one Fizz Drop tablet to each bottle. This small charge of sugar will carbonate (or “prime”) our flat beer—the CO2 gas created by this mini- fermentation will be absorbed by the liquid since it can’t escape the sealed bottle—thanks, science! Cap the bottles.', 'Wait just a little longer! It’ll be worth it— promise. Keep the filled, capped bottles at room temperature for approx. 1–2 weeks to let the beer carbonate. Test a bottle at one week—did it hiss when you opened it? If not, wait a week and try again. After this point, the bottles can be stored cold and upright. Imbibe! As if we really need to tell you how to do this! Assemble your tasting panel, clean your favorite beer glass, and crack open a bottle of fresh, handcrafted beer. Decant the beer into your glass.', 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2785/6868/products/m09_x700_1_x700.jpg?v=1579812108', 'https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/dry-irish-stout-small-batch-recipe-kit', '5');
